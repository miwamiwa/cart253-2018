RACOON RUN
By Samuel Par√©-Chouinard

- In this game you are a racoon and you scavenge for food.
- Each level has a number of good and bad food types available.
- You recognize good and bad foods by learning then detecting their "smell"
(represented as short looping musical phrases).
- each new level introduces a new kind of good or bad food, and randomizes
their smells.
- Avoid humans and fill yer belly!

I'm handing in a bit of a work in progress, but at some point you gotta draw
a line on some details (and finish up your other final projects). This version
is very playable. Here are a few issues I was working on at the time I'm
turning this in:

- levels are limited by the 6 musical phrases i created
- sound works great but sound design was a bit overlooked because of time spent
on collisions and visuals. sfx not used very extensively, and musical phrases
were thrown together quickly
- obstacle collisions are clunky. player gets glued all over the place and
has to change directions all the time.
- late in the process i tried changing the manner in which collisions were
checked, in an effort to enhance performance (necessary for slow computers
like mine). Updated only one collision-checking function (EnemyObject.lookOut())
in the interest of time, so not everything is as efficient as it could be.
The old system checks distance to all obstacles, then checks collisions
with nearby obstacles only, while the new system has obstacles, enemies and the
player organised in rows and columns and checks for collisions only within
matching rows or columns.
- texture image files were crunched to tiny sizes also to optimize performance.
my computer was not a fan of these more hi-res textures which were working fine
on school computers.
- i feel like i probably missed something but i don't know how to
display text in 3d, so i have objects with text images as texture :)

this script handles:
- declaring global variables
- main p5.js function such as preload, setup and draw
- built-in p5.js listeners such as keypressed, mousepressed, windowresized
- three main game functions: runMenu(), runGame(), runSound()
anything else is contained either in an object script or in events.js
