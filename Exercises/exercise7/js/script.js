Exercise 7
Racoon Run ( prototype for Project 3 )
by Samuel Par√©-Chouinard

in this game the player takes on the role of a racoon; he needs to
scavenge for food that's safe to eat and run away from humans.

all food objects look the same to your racoon eyes, yet some foods
are good and others are bad. when the racoon eats a food object, he
memorizes its "smell". If an object with a memorized smell falls within
the player's smelling range, the player will hear a specific melodic
line associated to the smell.
The player will know whether or not food is good when his racoonlike
digestive system expells droppings of a certain colour. He has to fill
his belly first. The delay between hitting a food object and then knowing
whether the food is good or not should hopefully make the game nice
and confusing?

TLDR Player must eat then poop to know if food is good. he also memorises
the smell of what he eats (represented as music). he will smell things
in range that's he's eaten previously. unsurprisingly, he doesn't smell
his own poop and assumes it's normal.

In this test version i only have 2 different foods. Could probably
add more kinds of food (many good foods and many bad foods, each with
different melodies) and/or have food objects move around once in a while.
maybe humans move it or they change position when eaten.

Human enemies wander around and rush towards the player if he's
in range and the view is clear of obstacles. This part of the code is
buggy but the core is there. It also feels pretty slow. Running multiple
enemies is a problem unless i fix things there. The enemies also don't
do anything so far when they run into the player, but the collision code
is pretty much there.

This game is going to need graphics and interesting sounds. Graphics
should help the game be understandable without all this text.
Game mechanics probably still need a bit of rethinking to make the game
engaging but I think there's interesting stuff to work with here.
I think to start I will look into adding a level progression that
would introduce more foods and more enemies and have clear goals for
the completion of a level; and I'll also look into having objects
move a bit more on screen.
